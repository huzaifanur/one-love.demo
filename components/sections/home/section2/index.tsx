        One Love Club is a Burlington-based organization focused on providing
        critical support for the special needs community in Vermont. We host a
        calendar of events where client&apos;s and caregiver&apos;s talents and
        skills are encouraged and where people with special needs can make
        friends, develop & share skills, and explore meaning and purpose. The
        group provides a safe environment of weekly activities that accepts and
        supports everyone&apos;s unique expression and encourages exploration
        and discovery.
